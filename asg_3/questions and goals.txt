How many globals can we get away with? What is the limit?

on toggling normals, when we hit the button, does it auto draw w/o normals or w/ normals? How I do that if it's immediate?

Inverted z-axis?

Did I implement the ortho-projection correctly?

Way to better my lab grade? Based on inverted z?

Better/preferred way to store verts, indc's, norms, and cols?

Do my cylinders look good as is. YES

occasionally parts of my cylinder don't draw out, and it's not based off a pattern, it's random. Is there a reason for this?

Why is my rubberbanding line colorfulm after one iteration?







GOALS:
Better way to store vertices, indices, normals, and colors

Make code more uniform/consistent

Expand out repeated code to helper functions


Steps to take Prog 2:
smooth
ambient
specular
