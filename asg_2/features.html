      <h3>Required</h3>
      <li>(REQUIRED) Assignment draws a fixed generalized cylinder. By default, the generalized cylinder should have 12 sides.</li>
      <li>(REQUIRED) If the user just draws a single straight line, a generalized cylinder is drawn around it.</li>
      <li>(REQUIRED) If the user draws a polyline, generalized cylinders are drawn around each line segment.</li>
      <li>(REQUIRED) The user can save the model currently on screen to an OBJ file.</li>
      <li> (REQUIRED) The user can load and display a model from an OBJ file.</li>
      <h3>Extras</h3>
      <li>(EXTRA) Intersections between sections of your generalized cylinder are covered so that there are no "gaps."</li>
      <li>(EXTRA) The user can have multiple cylinders on the screen at once.</li>
      <li>(EXTRA) The user can change the number of sides the cylinder has with a slider.</li>
      <li>(EXTRA) The user can change the width of the cylinder with a slider (i.e. the radius of the polygonal face).</li>
